Cleanup the following: A startup incubator firm specializes in helping startups prepare and launch. The organization is is divided into groups that each focuses on supporting a specific startup. Each group is supposed to led by leader who has prior experience as a startup assistants. In scaling the firm and taking on a new client, a new group is formed without such a leader. A month into supporting this startup, one of their members leaves temporarily to join a startup as they launch, gaining experience as a startup assistant. Upon returning to his original group, his new experience places him as the missing leader of the group. This group now must navigate this disruption of a new hierarchy as well as this leader having been an equal previously. Furthermore, this new leader has returned with new affectations he naturally picked up from the startup group he joined for launch, now appears different from how they remembered him. 2 / 2

rewrite in original words like a research student :Enterprise resource planning systems are comprehensive, integrated platforms, either on-premises or in the cloud, that manage every part of a production-based or distribution firm. ERP is, in a nutshell, the means of integrating individuals, processes, and technologies throughout a modern business. Obtaining appropriate, trustworthy, and maintainable ERP systems that can be used in businesses while also meeting the functional requirements of the organization, with a level of quality that is acceptable to the organization, is a significant challenge faced by majority of businesses in the country. Since maintainability is a crucial quality characteristic of software applications, ERP systems have occasionally been limited by maintainability issues. The process for predicting the maintainability of ERP software is explicitly described in this research and is based on design metrics and a statistical approach. The study explores if a set of metrics for class diagram structural attributes (size, complexity, coupling, and cohesion) could be useful indicators of class diagram maintainability based on the sub-characteristics of understandability, analyzability, and modifiability. Results show that the measures and recommended metrics can be used to identify the most powerful predictors and build useful prediction models for ERP applications. The statistical data study shows that while database and source code changes have a considerable impact on ERP maintainability quality, module customization has no effect on ERP quality. Our findings have repercussions for how firms implement customized ERP.

One of my small projects runs Apache httpd as a load balancer in front of two web servers which produce XML. I got a new requirement that the load balancer should look for an element in the response XML and, when present, consider the web server that produced it as overloaded and throttle requests to it. Available options are augmenting httpd's configuration or replacing it with a new (open source) Linux software LB. Traffic is <100 reqs/sec and less than 2MB/sec, latency is not an issue.\nHaving a software engineering background my instinct is to program an LB of my own and be done, but supporting that would require upskilling my team (who are not software engineers). With respect to existing LBs/API gateways, what are my options?

A 69-year-old man comes to his cardiologist for a follow-up visit. He is being considered for a new drug therapy that works by modulating certain proteins released from the heart in patients with heart failure. A drug called candoxatril is being investigated for its ability to inhibit the action of an endopeptidase that breaks down a vasodilatory mediator released from the heart, as well as, endothelin and bradykinin. This mediator is known to promote the excretion of sodium from the body and improve the ejection fraction. One of its side effects is its ability to increase angiotensin II levels which causes harm to patients with heart failure. Therefore, to improve efficacy and reduce its adverse effects, candoxatril has to be used in conjunction with angiotensin receptor blockers. Which of the following is most likely to increase as a result of this drug regimen?

Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by a double quote for grammar mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph — "Feedback is inherent in engineering education for teachers to provide comments about their students’ work. It provides opportunities for engineering students to overcome their current learning weaknesses and aims to close the learning gap for students to achieve course objectives (Subheesh & Sethy, 2020). Engineering students currently engage in feedback activities from receiving feedback from teachers for assessments and providing peer evaluations to other students. However, the feedback itself can be a time-consuming process for teachers and their provided feedback was often labelled as limited (Vardi, 2009). An AI-automated feedback tool can be utilized to enhance the feedback experience for engineering students. It allows real-time feedback for students and can provide feasible individual feedback to all students in a large engineering faculty (Deeva et al., 2021). Engineering students will be able to enhance their feedback literacy to understand and create dispositions from feedback to strengthen their learning (Carless & Boud, 2018). With real-time feedback generated from an AI feedback tool, engineering students will be able to engage in student-centered learning to gain a sense of direction for their learning and become self-paced with their studies (Tubino & Adachi, 2022). However, there is little understanding of the potential use of an AI-automated feedback tool for feedback to engineering students. In this research, surveys will be conducted and analyzed to examine the benefits of an AI feedback tool in engineering education."

I need your help to write an article. The topic is about a contract clause in the NSW HIA Lump Sum contract. If you understand, limit your reply by saying the word: "acknowledged".
The NSW HIA Lump Sum contract is subject to Section 14 of Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999 (NSW). Please acknowledge this for now.\n\n14 Payment schedules\n(1) A person on whom a payment claim is served (the respondent) may reply to the claim by providing a payment schedule to the claimant.\n(2) A payment schedule—\n(a) must identify the payment claim to which it relates, and\n(b) must indicate the amount of the payment (if any) that the respondent proposes to make (the scheduled amount).\n(3) If the scheduled amount is less than the claimed amount, the schedule must indicate why the scheduled amount is less and (if it is less because the respondent is withholding payment for any reason) the respondent’s reasons for withholding payment.\n(4) If—\n(a) a claimant serves a payment claim on a respondent, and\n(b) the respondent does not provide a payment schedule to the claimant—\n(i) within the time required by the relevant construction contract, or\n(ii) within 10 business days after the payment claim is served,\nwhichever time expires earlier,\nthe respondent becomes liable to pay the claimed amount to the claimant on the due date for the progress payment to which the payment claim relates.

I am sitting in a boat looking at the white mountains in front of me. They are big and tall. The water is making a reflection of them but that’s not all of it. There are some boats on the left side of me that are forming a curve. Also, there are some green trees in front of the mountains. I want so badly to jump off my boat and swim but I am scared of cold water.
write the following in bullets:\nOne of the advantages of using sequent systems as a framework for logical\nreasoning is that the resulting calculi are often simple, have good proof theoretical\nproperties (like cut-elimination, consistency, etc) and can be easily implemented,\n\eg\ using rewriting.\nHence it would be heaven if we could add axioms in mathematical theories to first\norder logics and reason about them using all the machinery already built for the\n\nsequent framework. Indeed, the general problem of extending standard proof-\ntheoretical results obtained for pure logic to certain classes of non-logical axioms\n\nhas been the focus of attention for quite some time now.\nThe main obstacle for this agenda is that adding non-logical axioms to systems\nwhile still maintaining the good proof theoretical properties is not an easy task. In\nfact, adding naively axioms to sequent systems often result in non cut-free\nsystems. One way of circumventing this problem is by treating axioms as theories,\nadded to the sequent context. This is already in Gentzen's consistency proof of\nelementary arithmetic. Now the derivations have only logical axioms as premises,\nand cut elimination applies.\nBut we can do better by transforming axioms into inference rules. In this talk, we\nwill propose a systematic way of adding inference rules to sequent systems. The\nproposal will be based on the notions of focusing and polarities. We will also\ndiscuss how our framework escalates to hypersequents and systems of rules.\nThis is a joint work with Dale Miller, Sonia Marin and Marco Volpe.
Write a Facebook post for a Perfex Cloud that will capture the attention of the company have sale b2b and persuade them to take digital tranformation in sales sector.

I have two trivial electronic circuits. One is current detector using two transistors, and the other is voltage meter usinf arduino. They both work fine separately, but when I try to out them on the same power supply, LED from first circuit burns out. Why?

Years later: MK is now in his late teens. He's up late in his room playing video games when he hears those noises again. He doesn't want to admit he's scared, so when the noises stop, he decides to go "check on his father" to make sure Sun Wukong isn't scared. When he gets to his father's bedroom, he finds Wukong fully dressed, holding his staff, and pacing around the room looking frustrated.
MK has no idea what to think; Mac says MK is different from his father, and if he becomes king, maybe his people will fare better\nMK is surprised Mac doesn’t want to be king again; Mac replies that of course he wants to be free, but he knows Wukong will never break the magic seal and he doubts MK can. Let's write that scene with details and dialogue.
MK reluctantly tells Mac it's been several days; his "camping trip" should be over by now. He offers to leave some supplies with Mac so he'll at least have a blanket, but Mac tells him no - if Wukong comes to visit him, finding anything, even some crumbs from their meals, could let him know someone else had been there, and he would realize it was MK quickly since no one can pass the barrier. MK and Mac work on clearing up the "campsite", leaving no evidence behind. Let's write that scene.
MK has an idea. He begins writing a spell on a piece of paper, telling Mac he thinks he knows how to lift the curse on his chains. But MK can't get close enough to Mac to cast the spell himself. He's going to leave the paper in front of Mac so Mac can read the spell aloud and break the curse, but he has to get close enough to set the paper down where Mac can see it, and that will activate the chains' curse and torture Mac until MK gets away. Let's write that whole scene and Mac's reaction to this plan.
Macaque wakes up first and talks to MK. MK's terrified of fighting his father - he knows he can't win. Macaque tells him to try outsmarting his father instead. Let's write that scene.
They stay in the village for a few days, helping the monkeys bury Wukong's victims and rebuild the destroyed buildings as the villagers start making weapons. MK is amazed at how much Macaque does to help the villagers recover from Wukong's attack. Let's write that scene.
The soldiers hold MK and Macaque, and they're forced to watch as the able-bodied villagers are led away to be forced into Wukong's army. Wukong looks at MK and Macaque and tells them that he would have killed them (or at least imprisoned them, he says, looking at Macaque in annoyance) if they posed a real threat to him - but they obviously don't. He warns them that his army will continue to grow, and that even when Macaque recovers his full powers, he won't stand a chance. Let's write that whole scene with details and dialogue.
